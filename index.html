    <h1>My Extremely Difficult Assignment</h1>

<p>Welcome to my assignment page! This document is structured using a variety of HTML tags to demonstrate their usage. Below is a summary of what I will be showcasing:</p>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment demonstrates how to use different HTML elements like heading tags, paragraph tags, lists, and anchors. It also includes file navigation with difficult file paths.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learn HTML tags</li>
    <li>Use lists for organizing content</li>
    <li>Navigate between different pages using anchor tag</li>
    <li>Work with images and links</li>
</ul>

    <li>Ensure that clicking on images navigates to another HTML page.</li>
    <li>Make sure clicking on text links navigates to another page with an extremely complex file path.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Image Navigation Example</h2>
<p>Click the image below to go to another HTML page:</p>

<a href="./HTML Files/about us.html"><img src="./Photos/Ocean image/ocean.jpeg" height="300px" width="200px" /></a>

<hr />
